## How to use this repo

This repo is intended to be forked by each team participating in ZetaChain's Alpha competition. Please follow these steps for your team:

- [ ] Fork this repo to your own private repo within the team captain's Github account
- [ ] Add the judge and the `c4-audit` user to your repo, for oversight
- [ ] Create a folder within your repo that includes your team name (or team membersâ€™ names, with captain's username first, e.g. `horsefacts-bytes032-Trust`). Create an index readme.md file in that folder that outlines the contents of the folder and attributes specific contributions by team members.
- [ ] Create the Phase 2 deliverables outlined in the Guidelines
- [ ] At the conclusion of Phase 2, the most recent commit **in your own repo** will be reviewed by the judge and sponsor. DO NOT share threats back to this repo. 

**Note:** Alpha repos should be made public following the competition; threats repos should be managed with great caution.
