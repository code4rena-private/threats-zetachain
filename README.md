- [ ] Create a folder within your repo that includes your team name (or team members’ names, with captain's username first, e.g. `horsefacts-bytes032-Trust`). Create an index readme.md file in that folder that outlines the contents of the folder and attributes specific contributions by team members.

**Note:** Alpha repos should be made public following the competition; threats repos should be managed with great caution.
